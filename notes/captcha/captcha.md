## What is Captcha?
CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a security mechanism designed to differentiate between human users and automated bots.

## Why do we use Captcha?
1. __Preventing Automated Bots__:  
Bots can automatically submit forms, create fake accounts, send spam, and perform other malicious activities. CAPTCHA ensures that only real human users can interact with specific web pages, such as login forms, registration forms, or comment sections.  
2. __Mitigating Spam__:  
CAPTCHA prevents automated systems from submitting spammy content, such as comments on blogs, posts in forums, or emails sent through contact forms. Without CAPTCHA, spammers could use bots to flood websites with irrelevant or harmful content.  
3. __Securing Web Forms__:  
CAPTCHA is often used on forms that require sensitive information, such as account registration, password resets, or payment processing. It helps ensure that malicious scripts can't exploit these forms to compromise accounts or steal personal information.
4. __Preventing Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks__:  
In DoS attacks, bots can overwhelm a server by sending massive amounts of traffic or making repeated requests. CAPTCHA helps by adding an additional step that bots can't easily complete, reducing the likelihood of successful attacks.
5. __Protecting Online Polls and Surveys__:  
Bots can skew the results of online polls or surveys by submitting multiple entries. CAPTCHA ensures that only humans can participate, maintaining the accuracy of the results.
6. __Thwarting Brute Force Attacks__:  
CAPTCHA can be used to slow down or block brute force attacks, where a bot tries to guess passwords or authentication credentials by repeatedly submitting login attempts. CAPTCHA interrupts the automated login attempts and forces a human user to complete the verification.

## How Captcha works?
Captcha relies on the fact that humans can process certain tasks, like recognizing distorted text or interpreting complex images, much better than machines. It presents a task that is easy for humans but challenging or computationally expensive for bots to solve, making it a useful tool for improving security.
