# Reasons that why 100% code coverage is not good
1. Achieving 100% code coverage does not guarantee code quality or correctness. Tests might focus on covering every line but miss critical edge cases or real-world scenarios, leading to a false sense of confidence in the software. Coverage tools only measure whether the code is executed, not whether it's tested meaningfully.

2. Chasing the last 10–20% of coverage requires significant effort for minimal gain.  The time spent getting to 100% could be much better spent adding value elsewhere, whether optimizing existing tests, pursuing automation opportunities, or developing new features. The closer you get to 100%, the more work for less meaningful return.

3. To hit 100% coverage, teams sacrifice good software design and test quality. In order to touch every single line and branch, tests often get bloated with duplication, tightly coupled to implementation details, and difficult to understand. It is an anti-pattern to add sleeps and waits purely to cover a complex section of code. Test quality and maintainability suffer in pursuit of the coverage target.

4. Some code paths should not be tested. Legacy code, generated code, getters and setters, uncommon errors handling are often covered just to increase coverage.Thoughtfully excluding some code from testing can be prudent if it does not represent application logic.

5. More tests don’t equal better product. A high quality, well-tested product with 80% coverage is far superior to a poorly tested one with 100% coverage.Tests might check if lines of code execute but ignore whether the logic behaves correctly.
