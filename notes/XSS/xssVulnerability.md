## What is XSS?
XSS is short for Cross Site Scripting and it is a prevalent web application vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects malicious code, usually in the form of JavaScript, into a vulnerable web application. The malicious code is executed by the victim’s web browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or even complete control over the affected user’s account.

## Main Types of XSS Vulnerabilities:
1. Stored XSS
2. Reflected XSS
3. DOM-based XSS

## Stored XSS:
Stored XSS attacks occur when a malicious script is injected into a web application’s data store, such as a database or content management system. This script is then served to users when they request the affected web page, leading to its execution in the context of their browser. Stored XSS is particularly dangerous because the injected script can be executed by any user who visits the affected page, potentially leading to a wide range of damaging consequences, including data theft and session hijacking.<br>

### Detecting Stored XSS:
- __Burp Suite__: Burp Suite is a popular web application security testing tool that can help you identify Stored XSS vulnerabilities. First you must download and install Burp Suite, and configure it to work as a proxy between your browser and the target web application. Then use Burp Suite’s Spider tool to crawl (to crawl a website is the automated process of systematically browsing and downloading content from website pages, typically for indexing and analyzing the website's content) the target web application, automatically discovering its content and functionality. After that we can launch Burp Suite’s Scanner tool, which will analyze the application for potential vulnerabilities, including Stored XSS. The scanner will automatically test various inputs and payloads to identify possible risks. Finally analyze the Scanner’s results, paying particular attention to any Stored XSS vulnerabilities it uncovers.<br>
- __Manual Testing__: Manual testing is another effective method for identifying Stored XSS vulnerabilities.
Analyze the web application to locate areas where user-generated content is stored and displayed, such as comment sections, user profiles, and message boards. Manually input various XSS payloads into these fields to test for potential vulnerabilities. Common payloads include JavaScript snippets, HTML tags, and encoded characters.
After submitting the payloads, check whether they are executed or displayed as plain text when viewing the affected pages. If the payloads are executed, this may indicate a Stored XSS vulnerability.<br>
- __OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)__: A security testing tool which can help you identify Stored XSS risks through automated scanning and manual testing.<br>
- __XSStrike__: A specialized XSS detection tool, XSStrike uses fuzzing and intelligent payload generation to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities, including Stored XSS. <br>

## Reflected XSS: 
Reflected XSS, also known as Non-Persistent XSS, is a type of Cross-Site Scripting attack in which a malicious script is included as a parameter in a URL or form submission. When a user clicks on a malicious link or submits a form containing the script, it is sent to the server and then “reflected” back to the user’s browser, where it is executed. Unlike Stored XSS, the malicious script is not stored on the server, making Reflected XSS attacks often harder to detect. These attacks typically rely on social engineering tactics, such as phishing emails, to trick users into clicking malicious links.<br>

### Detecting Reflected XSS:
To detect Reflected XSS Vulnerabilities we can use the tools we mentioned above. For Manual testing, first we must look for areas in the web application where user input is included in the URL or form submissions, such as search fields, login forms, and URL parameters. Then create a variety of XSS payloads, including JavaScript snippets and HTML tags, to test for potential vulnerabilities. Manually input your XSS payloads into the identified targets and observe the application’s response. If the payload is reflected back and executed in the browser, this may indicate a Reflected XSS vulnerability.

### Mitigating Reflected XSS:
1. __Input Validation__: Validate all user input to ensure it conforms to the expected format and length. Reject any input that does not meet these criteria.<br>
2. __Output Encoding__: Encode user input before incorporating it into URLs, HTML, or JavaScript code. This helps prevent malicious scripts from being executed in users browsers.<br>
3. __Content Security Policy (CSP)__: Implement a strong Content Security Policy to restrict the types of content that can be executed within your application. This can help limit the potential damage of a Reflected XSS attack.<br>

## DOM-based XSS: 
DOM-based XSS is a client-side vulnerability that involves manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page to inject malicious scripts. Unlike Stored or Reflected XSS attacks, DOM-based XSS does not involve sending a malicious payload to the server. Instead, the attack exploits client-side JavaScript code, typically by manipulating variables, URL fragments, or other elements of the DOM. The malicious script is then executed in the user’s browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

## Captcha and XSS vulnerabilities:
Captcha can stop automated tools and bots from submitting forms with malicious scripts, which might attempt to inject XSS payloads into user-generated content (e.g., comment sections, forums).
By requiring a CAPTCHA solution for form submissions, it becomes more challenging for attackers to use automated scripts to submit XSS payloads at scale. This slows down the process, potentially discouraging automated XSS attacks that rely on mass submission.
But it does not stop manually entered XSS payloads by human attackers, so it cannot fully prevent XSS.
