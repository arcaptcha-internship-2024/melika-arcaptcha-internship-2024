## What is XSS?
XSS is short for Cross Site Scripting and it is a prevalent web application vulnerability that occurs when an attacker injects malicious code, usually in the form of JavaScript, into a vulnerable web application. The malicious code is executed by the victim’s web browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or even complete control over the affected user’s account.

## Main Types of XSS Vulnerabilities:
1. Stored XSS
2. Reflected XSS
3. DOM-based XSS
